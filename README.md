This Repository acts as an Artifact for the submission of our manuscript to PACT 23'

## Paper Title
UWOmp𝑝𝑟𝑜 : UWOmp++ with Point-to-Point Synchronization, Reduction and Schedules

## Paper Authors
Aditya Agrawal and V Krishna Nandivada

## Affiliation
Indian Institute of Technology, Madras

## Prerequisite Software

> Install Build Essential
>> sudo apt-get install build-essential

> Install JDK-17
>> sudo apt-get install openjdk-17-jre

> Install Ant To Build the Translator
>> sudo apt-get install ant

## Clone the Benchmark and Enter the Directory

>> git clone https://github.com/adityaag24/artifact-pact.git

>> cd artifact-pact

## Steps to Build the Translator

> The two command below will build the Translator .class files and put them in the bin folder. 

>> ant clean
>> ant 

## Steps to Run The Standard Benchmarks
./runBmk.sh: will first run gcc to generate the preprocessed output which forms as an input to the IMOP Compiler Module. 
The IMOP Compiler Module will take as input the preprocessed file and output a $FILENAME-processed.i file (where FILENAME is the name of the benchmark) in the output-dump directory.
Then, the benchmark is compiled using gcc (with options -O3 and -fopenmp) that generates the executable $FILENAME, which can be run.

## Steps to Use UWPro for any arbitrary file (FILENAME.c)

> Generate the Preprocessed Output of the .c file you want to run. 

>> Make sure you add the header file present in src/utility/generic/header.h when compiling your benchmark.

>> gcc -P -E -o FILENAME.i FILENAME.c

> Run the Command to Translate the Given Preprocessed file to Processed Output (from the Translator)

>> java -da -Xms2048M -Xmx4096M -cp ${IMOPHOME}/third-party-tools/com.microsoft.z3.jar:. imop.$2 -nru -f $TESTROOT/$FILE

> Compile the Translated Benchmark using GCC/CLANG

>> gcc/clang -fopen -O3 -o FILENAME FILENAME-processed.i (this file is generated by the translator in the output-dump directory)

> Run the Translated Benchmark

>> ./FILENAME [Optional Input If Any]
